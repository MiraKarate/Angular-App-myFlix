## Angular 
MyFlix App is a client-side application built using Angular. Angular is a powerful JavaScript framework for building web applications with dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It's widely used for creating single-page applications (SPAs) and is designed for large-scale, complex projects.

If you're new to Angular, you may find it helpful to explore the Angular documentation to gain a better understanding of how this client-side application is structured and how components are used to build the user interface.
